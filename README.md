# To-Do List App

## Introduction

The To-Do List App is a simple and intuitive web application that allows users to keep track of their tasks. Users can add new tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them when no longer needed. The app also saves the tasks in the browser's local storage, ensuring that the tasks persist even after the browser is closed or refreshed.

## Features

- Add new tasks to the list.
- Mark tasks as completed by clicking on them.
- Delete tasks by clicking the delete button (Ã—).
- Tasks persist in local storage.

## Technologies Used

### HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to structure the content of the web application. The main components include the input box for task entry, the button to add tasks, and the unordered list to display tasks.

### CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style the HTML elements. It enhances the visual presentation of the app, making it more user-friendly and visually appealing. The CSS file includes styles for the container, to-do app layout, input box, buttons, and task list items.

### JavaScript

JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the app. It handles the addition, completion, and deletion of tasks. It also manages saving and retrieving tasks from the local storage to ensure that tasks persist between browser sessions.
